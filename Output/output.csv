7,1,72,"I bought this last week so my wife, who has a broken ankle, could summon me from upstairs where I work.<br /><br />Initially we were very pleased with the pager system.  It's quite complete down to having mounting screws and adhesive tape should you want a permanent mount for the call buttons.  The \\""ding dong\\"" tone is quite loud enough for me to hear and I'm hearing impaired.  The \\""alarm\\"" call will wake the dead.  The unit demonstrated enough range to cover our entire two story 2500 sq ft home. We put one transmitter button by my wife's side of the bed and adhesive mounted the other to her walker.<br /><br />Within two days problems arose.  The receiver belt clip is very poorly done and will not hold.  When the receiver falls to the floor the battery compartment lid flys off and the two batteries scatter.  After the third or fourth fall, the connectors to the batteries started coming loose.<br /><br />Yesterday the transmitter by my wife's bed stopped functioning reliably.  Now, the button has to be pressed just so in just the right spot, off to one side or it won't transmit.  The red light that's supposed to indicate successful transmission will light even though no transmission occurred.  When she wakes up and needs me to come help her up so she can take care of business, she doesn't have her glasses on so finding the right spot on the transmitter button to press isn't in the cards.  She's reduced to yelling and hoping I hear her.<br /><br />We've put the more reliable button from the walker by her bed and we test both both buttons daily.  Tomorrow I'm contacting the manufacturer.  I've also bought a pocket camera case to hold the receiver in the hope of prolonging its life.<br /><br />All in all, this product is a very good idea spoiled to a large extent by failure to attend to the details.<br /><br />Feb 05 Update<br />I called the only phone number I had, which was for the manufacturer, and had one of the best customer support experiences ever.  The manufacturer's customer support person relayed me over to the seller's customer support.  That person immediately said they'd overnight a replacement system to me.  My phone call was in the late afternoon PST.  Before noon the NEXT DAY, the replacement system was at my front door.  It turns out the transmitters and the receiver are frequency bonded so they couldn't just replace the button transmitter.<br /><br />The new system works OK.  The buttons are pretty sensitive to how they're pushed, which isn't good but we've learned their foibles and have mounted them so they're easier to push correctly.  The camera case works well to carry the receiver.  I never turn the receiver off so I can't forget to turn it on.  Even if I forget to clip it to my belt loop and leave it on the kitchen table (its standard parking place if I'm going out of the house), I can hear it upstairs.omer support.

Capacity & Auto Recognition Technology]], but for a simple, low cost weight only scale that could be thrown in the checked luggage this fit the bill (it is not billed as a travel scale, a tad heavy  at 4+ pounds). The glass surface is smooth glass finish on the top surface and back-painted white. As another reviewer pointed out, the color of the scale reads green, like the color seen when looking at the polished edge of a piece of non-low-iron glass, in difference to the rendition of the stock product photos. In our experience with this product, it is good scale for the price point.

12,1,25,"Good scale, functions adequately for our purposes, however I had hoped the base would be a little more weighty to keep the scale stable. We have a 2 year old, and he could EASILY topple this scale sideways. Heck, a gust of wind might do it, even. Straight out of the box, I noticed the indicator arm housing was bent. There was no package damage inside or out, so it had to have occurred before or during packing, not shipment, which makes me question Detecto's quality control standards. Fortunately the bend was not bad, and easily bent back by hand, which does not speak well for sturdiness of materials in the design, either.<br />The zero seems to set and stay well, but I think they should have made the turn-screw with a Phillips head socket or included a knob of some type for adjusting the zero; The flat head slot is awkward for older hands to maintenance.<br />Otherwise, functionality is very good, we verified its accuracy with other scales and specific dumbbells of known weights.<br />For the price, it is more than adequate, and if you have none of the issues I mentioned above, I could see someone rating this scale as high as 4 stars, but not five.

34,1,6,"I recently picked this unit up at Bed and Bath where it was $99.00. With a 20% coupon the price was $80 (so comparison shop!) It's easy to use and seems to work well. I agree with other reviewers about the noise level (loud like a tea kettle boiling), but I use this unit in the living room area so sleeping is not an issue. Having the 2 separate water reservoirs to fill is much easier, weight-wise, as I previously had another humidifier which had one large water reservoir and it was very heavy when full. The unit comes apart quite easily for cleaning and since frequent cleaning is recommended (I usually do it 1x per week, not daily) this is a definite plus. Additionally, one only needs to use vinegar to clean the inside reservoir, which is a lot cheaper than having to buy some kind of \\""special\\"" cleaning solution. My one complaint is that it doesn't, but should, have an automatic shut off when both tanks are empty.I have to remember to turn the unit off when I leave the house.

They are like have racket balls on the ends of sticks to beat your muscle spasms and to lie down on them rolling around on your back. It is worth the money.  They use a device similar to this in physical therapy so if you get your doctor to write you a script for it, insurance may very well pay for it like mine did.

38,0,1,"I purchased this cane to assist me when I have to walk long distances.  I have rheumatoid arthritis that has particularly affected my low back and hips, and it sometimes makes walking difficult.  The problem with using a cane when you have RA is that RA doesn't just affect your lower extremities.  My hands, wrists, and shoulders are also affected.  When I tried a normal cane, it was agonizingly painful for my hand and wrist in particular.  That made it not worth using, even though it did help my hip and back.  A friend with similar issues recommended this one, and the difference was amazing.  It is still a bit hard on my hand after awhile, but not to the point that would make it not worth using.  There really is no perfect solution for this circumstance short of a wheelchair, and I'm nowhere near ready for that yet!
